Binding refers to the association between an entity (variable, function, or type) and a specific property or value. The method of binding directly influences the visibility, lifespan, and accessibility of data and functions within a program

Deep and shallow binding are two methods used to determine how subprograms access non-local variables when they are passed around as first-class citizens in programming languages. Deep binding preserves the context of the subprogram's definition, while shallow binding uses the context of the subprogram's execution

Ad hoc binding is a method of passing subprogram as the parameter where the referencing environment is the environment of the call which passed subprogram as an argument
