A sentential form is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals that can be derived from the start symbol of a grammar through a series of production rules

In a rightmost derivation, at each step, the rightmost non-terminal in the sentential form is replaced with one of its production rules (bottom up parsing)

A handle is the portion of a string that matches the right side of a production rule and can be reduced directly to a non-terminal (the left or rightmost simple phrase depending on derivation)
